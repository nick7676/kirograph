# KiroGraph

KiroGraph builds a semantic knowledge graph of your codebase. Use its MCP tools instead of grep/glob/file reads whenever \`.kirograph/\` exists in the project.

## Quick decision guide

| Find a symbol by name | \`kirograph_search\` |
| Who calls function X? | \`kirograph_callers\` |
| What does function X call? | \`kirograph_callees\` |

## Tool reference

### \`kirograph_context\` — **start here for any code task**

Returns entry points, related symbols, and code snippets for a natural-language task description. Usually enough to orient without any additional tool calls.

\`\`\`
kirograph_context(task: "fix the auth token expiry bug")
kirograph_context(task: "add dark mode", maxNodes: 30)
kirograph_context(task: "refactor payment service", includeCode: false)
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_search\` — find symbols by name

Exact match → FTS → LIKE fallback → vector (last resort). Use instead of grep.

\`\`\`
kirograph_search(query: "signIn")
kirograph_search(query: "UserService", kind: "class")
kirograph_search(query: "auth", limit: 20)
\`\`\`

Supported kinds: \`function\`, \`method\`, \`class\`, \`interface\`, \`type_alias\`, \`variable\`, \`route\`, \`component\`

### \`kirograph_node\` — inspect a symbol

Returns kind, file, signature, docstring. Add \`includeCode: true\` to get the full source.

\`\`\`
kirograph_node(symbol: "validateToken")
kirograph_node(symbol: "AuthService", includeCode: true)
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_callers\` — who calls this?

BFS over incoming \`calls\` edges (depth 1).

\`\`\`
kirograph_callers(symbol: "processPayment", limit: 30)
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_callees\` — what does this call?

BFS over outgoing \`calls\` edges (depth 1).

\`\`\`
kirograph_callees(symbol: "handleRequest")
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_impact\` — blast radius before a change

Traverses all incoming edges up to \`depth\` hops. Call this before editing a symbol.

\`\`\`
kirograph_impact(symbol: "UserRepository", depth: 3)
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_path\` — how are two symbols connected?

BFS shortest path across all edge types.

\`\`\`
kirograph_path(from: "LoginController", to: "DatabasePool")
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_type_hierarchy\` — class/interface inheritance

\`\`\`
kirograph_type_hierarchy(symbol: "BaseRepository", direction: "down")  // derived types
kirograph_type_hierarchy(symbol: "PaymentService", direction: "up")    // base types
kirograph_type_hierarchy(symbol: "IUserStore", direction: "both")      // all
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_dead_code\` — unreferenced symbols

Returns unexported symbols with zero incoming edges. Good first step when cleaning up.

\`\`\`
kirograph_dead_code(limit: 50)
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_circular_deps\` — import cycles

Runs Tarjan's SCC over import edges. No parameters needed.

\`\`\`
kirograph_circular_deps()
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_files\` — indexed file structure

\`\`\`
kirograph_files(format: "tree")                          // default
kirograph_files(format: "flat")                          // one path per line
kirograph_files(format: "grouped")                       // by directory
kirograph_files(filterPath: "src/auth", maxDepth: 2)
kirograph_files(pattern: "**/*.test.ts")
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_status\` — index health

Returns file count, symbol count, edge count, embedding coverage, DB size. Call when something feels off.

### \`kirograph_hotspots\` — most-connected symbols

Returns the top-N symbols by total edge degree (in + out, excluding structural \`contains\` edges). Use to find core abstractions, identify high blast-radius symbols before a refactor, or understand what the codebase revolves around.

\`\`\`
kirograph_hotspots(limit: 20)
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_surprising\` — unexpected cross-module coupling

Finds direct edges between symbols in structurally distant files, scored by path distance × edge-kind weight. Use before a refactor to discover hidden dependencies that will break. High score = more unexpected.

\`\`\`
kirograph_surprising(limit: 20)
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_diff\` — what changed since a snapshot?

Compares the current graph against a saved snapshot. Shows added/removed symbols and edges. A snapshot must exist — the user saves one with \`kirograph snapshot save <label>\` before making changes.

\`\`\`
kirograph_diff()                              // vs latest snapshot
kirograph_diff(snapshot: "pre-refactor")     // vs named snapshot
\`\`\`

---

## Architecture tools *(require \`enableArchitecture: true\` in config)*

### \`kirograph_architecture\` — **start here for architectural questions**

Returns the full package graph, detected layers (api/service/data/ui/shared), and their dependency edges.

\`\`\`
kirograph_architecture()                    // packages + layers
kirograph_architecture(level: "packages")
kirograph_architecture(level: "layers")
kirograph_architecture(includeFiles: true)  // add file→package assignments
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_coupling\` — stability metrics per package

Returns Ca (afferent — depended on by), Ce (efferent — depends on), and instability (Ce/(Ca+Ce)).
- High Ca + low instability = load-bearing, safe to depend on, risky to change interface.
- High Ce + high instability = depends on many things, safe to refactor internals.

\`\`\`
kirograph_coupling()                        // all packages, sorted by instability
kirograph_coupling(sortBy: "afferent")     // most depended-on first
kirograph_coupling(sortBy: "efferent")     // most outgoing deps first
\`\`\`

### \`kirograph_package\` — drill into one package

Returns metadata, coupling metrics, outgoing deps, incoming dependents, and file list.

\`\`\`
kirograph_package(package: "auth")
kirograph_package(package: "src/services", includeFiles: false)
\`\`\`

## Workflows

**Bug fix or feature:**
1. \`kirograph_context\` — orient, find entry points.
2. \`kirograph_node\` with \`includeCode: true\` — read the relevant symbol.
3. \`kirograph_callers\` / \`kirograph_callees\` — trace the call flow.
4. \`kirograph_impact\` — check blast radius before editing.

**Refactor planning:**
1. \`kirograph_hotspots\` — identify the most-connected symbols; changing these is risky.
2. \`kirograph_surprising\` — surface hidden coupling that will break.
3. \`kirograph_impact\` on specific targets — confirm blast radius.
4. \`kirograph_diff\` after the refactor — verify the structural change matches intent.

**Architectural review:**
1. \`kirograph_architecture\` — get the package and layer map.
2. \`kirograph_coupling\` — find the most stable (high Ca) and most volatile (high instability) packages.
3. \`kirograph_package\` — drill into any package of interest.
4. \`kirograph_circular_deps\` — check for import cycles.

**Code cleanup:**
1. \`kirograph_dead_code\` — find unreferenced unexported symbols.
2. \`kirograph_circular_deps\` — find import cycles to untangle.
3. \`kirograph_surprising\` — find unexpected coupling to decouple.

## If \`.kirograph/\` does NOT exist

Ask the user: "This project doesn't have KiroGraph initialized. Run \`kirograph init -i\` to build a code knowledge graph for faster exploration?"

## Output Compression (\\\`kirograph_exec\\\`)

When running shell commands, prefer \\\`kirograph_exec\\\` over raw shell execution for:
- **git** operations (status, log, diff, push, pull, commit)
- **test runners** (jest, vitest, pytest, cargo test, go test, rspec)
- **linters/build** (eslint, tsc, ruff, clippy, cargo build, prettier, biome)
- **file listings** (ls, find, tree)
- **docker/k8s** (docker ps, images, logs, kubectl pods, logs)
- **package managers** (npm install/list, pip list, bundle install)

This saves 60-90% of tokens compared to raw output.

Compression level: **${level}** — ${LEVEL_DESCRIPTIONS[level]}

${LEVEL_EXAMPLES[level]}

**Important:** Error details are always preserved. Failed commands show full diagnostic output regardless of level.

Use \\\`kirograph_gain\\\` to check token savings statistics.`;
