KiroGraph builds a local semantic knowledge graph of this codebase. When the \`kirograph\` MCP server is available, prefer its tools over broad grep/glob/file-read exploration.

## Tool selection

- Start code tasks with \`kirograph_context\`.
- Find symbols by name with \`kirograph_search\`.
- Inspect a symbol with \`kirograph_node\`; set \`includeCode: true\` only when source is needed.
- Trace call flow with \`kirograph_callers\` and \`kirograph_callees\`.
- Check blast radius before edits with \`kirograph_impact\`.
- Use \`kirograph_path\` to explain how two symbols connect.
- Use \`kirograph_type_hierarchy\` for inheritance/interface questions.
- Use \`kirograph_files\` to inspect indexed file structure.
- Use \`kirograph_status\` if results seem stale or incomplete.
- Use \`kirograph_architecture\`, \`kirograph_coupling\`, and \`kirograph_package\` for package/layer questions when architecture analysis is enabled.
- Use \`kirograph_hotspots\`, \`kirograph_surprising\`, and \`kirograph_diff\` for refactor planning and review.

## Workflow

1. Call \`kirograph_context\` for orientation.
2. Drill into specific symbols with \`kirograph_node\`.
3. Use graph traversal tools before reading unrelated files.
4. Fall back to normal filesystem tools only when the graph is missing, stale, or lacks the needed detail.

If \`.kirograph/\` does not exist, ask whether to run \`kirograph init --index\`.

    content += `
## Shell Compression (\`kirograph_exec\`)

When running shell commands, prefer \`kirograph_exec\` over raw shell execution for:
- **git** operations (status, log, diff, push, pull, commit, add, fetch, branch)
- **GitHub CLI** (gh pr list/view, gh issue list, gh run list)
- **test runners** (jest, vitest, pytest, cargo test, go test, rspec, minitest, playwright)
- **linters/build** (eslint, tsc, ruff, clippy, cargo build, prettier, biome, golangci-lint, rubocop, next build)
- **file listings** (ls, find, tree)
- **search** (grep, rg/ripgrep: grouped by file)
- **diff** (diff file1 file2: condensed context)
- **docker/k8s** (docker ps, images, logs, compose ps, kubectl pods, logs, services)
- **package managers** (npm/pnpm install/list, pip list/install, bundle install, prisma generate)
- **AWS CLI** (sts, ec2, lambda, logs, cloudformation, dynamodb, iam, s3, ecs, sqs, sns)
- **network** (curl, wget: strip progress bars and headers)

This saves 60-90% of tokens compared to raw output.

Compression level: **${level}**: ${LEVEL_DESCRIPTIONS[level]}

${LEVEL_EXAMPLES[level]}

**Important:** Error details are always preserved. Failed commands show full diagnostic output regardless of level.

**Do NOT re-run commands:** When \`kirograph_exec\` returns a result, treat it as the final answer. Never re-run the same command with raw shell execution to "get more details." The compressed output preserves all essential information. If you genuinely need something missing from the output, explain what's missing before making a second call.

Use \`kirograph_gain\` to check token savings statistics.

  // Memory section
  if (enableMemory) {
    content += `
## Memory

KiroGraph has persistent memory. Use \`kirograph_mem_search\` to recall past decisions,
errors, and patterns before making changes. Use \`kirograph_mem_store\` to save important
observations (architecture decisions, bug root causes, patterns discovered).

Memory is searchable via hybrid FTS + vector search. Observations are automatically
linked to code symbols in the graph and surface in \`kirograph_context\` and
\`kirograph_impact\` results when relevant.

**When to store:** After fixing a bug, making an architecture decision, discovering a pattern,
encountering a non-obvious error, or learning something about the codebase that future sessions
should know. Keep observations concise — one fact per store call.
`;
  }

  // Architecture section
  if (enableArchitecture) {
    content += `
## Architecture

KiroGraph analyzes the package structure and layer dependencies of the codebase.

- \`kirograph_architecture\` — full package graph, detected layers (api/service/data/ui/shared), dependency edges
- \`kirograph_coupling\` — Ca (afferent), Ce (efferent), instability per package; high Ca = load-bearing, high Ce = volatile
- \`kirograph_package\` — drill into a single package: coupling metrics, deps, dependents, files

Use \`kirograph_architecture\` for architectural questions instead of reading directory trees.
High Ca + low instability = risky to change interface. High Ce + high instability = safe to refactor internals.
`;
  }

  // Documentation section
  if (enableDocs) {
    content += `
## Documentation

KiroGraph indexes project documentation by heading structure. Use \`kirograph_docs_search\`
to find relevant sections instead of reading entire files.

- \`kirograph_docs_toc\` — table of contents for a file or the whole project
- \`kirograph_docs_search\` — search sections by query
- \`kirograph_docs_section\` — retrieve full section content by ID
- \`kirograph_docs_outline\` — heading hierarchy for a single file
- \`kirograph_docs_refs\` — code ↔ doc cross-references

Before reading a doc file directly, try \`kirograph_docs_search\` or \`kirograph_docs_outline\` first.
`;
  }

  // Data section
  if (enableData) {
    content += `
## Data

KiroGraph indexes tabular data files (CSV, TSV, JSONL, JSON, Excel, Parquet).

- \`kirograph_data_list\` — list all indexed datasets
- \`kirograph_data_describe\` — schema profile: column names, types, cardinality, samples
- \`kirograph_data_query\` — filtered row retrieval (eq, gt, contains, in, between)
- \`kirograph_data_aggregate\` — server-side GROUP BY: count, sum, avg, min, max

Use \`kirograph_data_describe\` before reading a data file. Use \`kirograph_data_query\` with
filters instead of loading all rows. Use \`kirograph_data_aggregate\` for statistics.
This saves 95-99% of tokens compared to reading raw data files.
`;
  }

  // Security section
  if (enableSecurity) {
    content += `
## Security

KiroGraph scans dependency manifests across 14 ecosystems for known vulnerabilities, performs
call-graph reachability analysis, tracks EPSS exploitation probability, checks license
compliance, and monitors dependency staleness.

**Available tools:**
- \`kirograph_security\` — overview: dep count, CVE count, verdict breakdown, stale warnings
- \`kirograph_vulns\` — list CVEs with severity, EPSS score, reachability verdict, fix suggestion
- \`kirograph_reachability\` — call paths, entry points, affected layers for one CVE or package
- \`kirograph_licenses\` — list dependency licenses; flag policy violations
- \`kirograph_staleness\` — identify outdated dependencies (staleness score 0.0–1.0)
- \`kirograph_sbom\` / \`kirograph_vex\` — export CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM and VEX documents
- \`kirograph_vuln_add\` — manually register a private/internal CVE

**Proactive triggers:** Run \`kirograph_security\` when a dependency is added/updated, before a
production deploy, or when the user asks about security/compliance.

**Interpreting verdicts:**
- \`affected\` — a call path exists from an entry point to the vulnerable code. Act on this.
- \`not_affected\` — no reachable path found. Strong signal: likely safe.
- \`under_investigation\` — unresolved symbols in traversal. Treat with caution.

**EPSS scores:** >= 0.5 = patch immediately; 0.1–0.5 = elevated risk; < 0.1 = low probability.

**Workflow:** \`kirograph_security\` → \`kirograph_vulns --verdict affected\` → \`kirograph_reachability <cve>\` → fix → \`kirograph_vulns --refresh\`

  // Pattern matching section

    content += `
## Pattern Search

KiroGraph supports AST structural pattern search via \`kirograph_live_search\` (only available when \`enablePatterns: true\` and \`@ast-grep/napi\` is installed).

- \`kirograph_live_search\` — find any structural code pattern across the indexed file list
- \`kirograph pattern --list\` — browse 10 bundled SAST rules (SQL injection, eval, path traversal, etc.)
- \`kirograph pattern --library <id>\` — run a specific library rule

Use \`kirograph_live_search\` when you need to find patterns that can't be expressed as symbol names: anonymous functions, specific code structures, or security anti-patterns.

This tool does not have automatic sync hooks. To keep the index fresh:
- Run \`kirograph sync\` at the **start** of each session if files changed outside the agent.
- Run \`kirograph sync\` at the **end** of each session after making changes.
- If results from graph tools seem stale, run \`kirograph sync\` before retrying.
